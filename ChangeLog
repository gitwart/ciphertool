      attempted.  It turns out that this doesn't give as much as
      a performance boost as I had hoped.
    * aristocrat.c:  Fixed bugs in reporting of alternate substitution
      ciphertext characters.  Added a "-strict" option to indicate of
      an alternate substitution should be treated as an error (strict=true) or
      not (strict=false).  Added "aristocrat undo" with no argumenets to
      undo entire cipher.

      period 11.
    * progs/csolve:  Changed default step interval for amsco ciphers.

      releases (athlon, i686).  Fixed test target so that it no longer
      clobbers the pkgIndex.tcl file.  Fixed test target so that it won't
      dump core when using the dmalloc library.

    * library/hillclimbCiphers.tcl:  Added support for hillclimbing a 6x6
      bifid cipher.
    * caesar.c:  Add { and } to list of valid caesar cipher characters (they
      just get ignored during the shift).

    * playfair.c:  Improved memory management of interpreter results.
    * cmbifidsolve:
    * digrafidsolve:  Don't exclude keys of length < 4 or > 15 since they make

      new keys for the twosquare cipher.
    * trisquaretipearch:  Added simple program for locating good matches for
      a trisquare tip based on the number of naturals in each possible tip
      location.
    * library/hillclimb.tcl:  Added new routine for performing a hillclimb
      on every possible pat tip location.  This turns out to be very useful
      for hillclimbing on a conjugated matrix bifid cipher, or for just
      hillclimbing a pat cipher where the tip location is not known.
    * progs/pathilltipsearch:
    * progs/cmbifidsolve:  Use the new library routine for performing a
      hillclimb on every possible pat tip location.

    * cipher.h:  Added more routes.
    * aristocrat.c:  Moved allocation of one piece of memory until after
      some extra input validation.
    * route.c:  Added "-numroutes" option so that new routes can be
      added without necessatating the need to modify the route-based
      scripts.  Added 12 new routes for row x row (normal and alternating)
      and col x col (normal and alternating) starting in the other 3 corners.
    * solvemysz.c:  Changed type of the iteration counter to an unsigned
      long.

Thu Aug  7 12:33:45 CEST 2003 wart@kobold.org
    * bacon.c:  Highly optimized the solve routine.  Sped up solving by
      two orders of magnitude.  It's now possible to go through all 2^26
      possible baconian keys and filter out the invalid bacon text (anything
      that causes a group to start with 2 b's) in under 10 seconds on a 2.4GHz
      computer.
    * route.c:  Fixed bug in route autosolver that was causing it not to
      restore the cipher to the best known route when finished.
    * progs/csolve:  Use better command line processing to make command line
      arguments easier to use.
    * progs/cmbifidsolve:  Improved the command line usage.  Made it possible
      to specify a tip without a tip starting location.

    * Makefile.in:  Added rpm optimization flags to the standalone apps
      solvemysz and solver.  Move RPM optimization flags after the normal
      C flags for the tcipher objects so that the RPM -O optimization takes
      precedence.
    * configure.in:
    * configure:
    * cipher.spec:  Bumped version to 1.5.6

Tue Aug  5 14:47:58 CEST 2003 wart@kobold.org
    * Many memory leak cleanups.
    * cipherInit.c:  Removed false comment.
    * cipherUtil.c:  Removed some unnecessary debugging lines.
    * aristocrat.c:  Removed a small memory leak in the tip location
      procedure.  Made the calls to Tcl_SetResult() more efficient by
      indicating when the result does not have to be duplicated by the
      interpreter.
    * bacon.c:
    * bifid.c:
    * bigbifid.c:
    * cadenus.c:
    * fmorse.c:

    * homophonic.c:
    * playfair.c:
    * swagman.c:
    * trifid.c:
    * twosquare.c:  Memory leak cleanups.  Some major, some minor.
    * stat.c:
    * route.c:
    * phillips.c:  Attempts to make more small optimizations.  Looks like
      they had very little effect.
    * all cipher types:  Made decipher procedure semantics identical across
      all ciphers.  Get* procs do not set interpreter result, that is the
      prerogative of the caller.   Use more efficient method when freeing
      the memory for the deciphered plaintext; instead of creating a duplicate,
      just pass control of the memory to the Tcl interpreter.
    * All C files:  Added debug header file that gets used only if dmalloc
      support is turned on.
    * cipher.c:  Don't double-delete the cipher object if there was an
      error creating the cipher object command.
    * cipherDebug.h:  Added a header file that enables the dmalloc memory
      management/debugging library, only if dmalloc has been selected
      through the configure script.
    * tests/vvb.test:
    * tests/cadenus.test:  Minor test cleanup.
    * tests/aristocrat.test:  Added test case showing the behaviour when
      the cipher command could not be created.

      utils library.
    * configure.in:  Added support for linking in the dmalloc debugging memory
      management library.
    * Makefile.in:  Add "dmalloc.log" to list of cleanup files.  Add
      RPM_OPT_FLAGS from the rpm spec file when building a RPM.
    * progs/keysquaresearch:  Replaced expensive regsub with a call to
      'string map'
    * progs/hillclimb:  Removed unnecessary comment.

Mon Aug  4 11:31:47 CEST 2003 wart@kobold.org
    * Massive optimizations.
    * vigTypes.h:  Rewrite the vigenere/variant/beaufort pt/ct/key
      routines as compiler macros to optimize their performance.
    * vigTypes.c:  Removed expensive pt/ct/key conversion routines for
      vigenere types as they have been replaced with lightweight macros.
    * vvb.c:  Use the new macros to simplify the code.  It's much more
      readable now.
    * nicodemus.c:  Use a (semi)static buffer for storing the nicodemus
      plaintext so that we don't have to reallocate memory for every call
      to GetNicodemus().  Removed some unused code.  Added a faster
      solving routine that fits the alphabet before permuting the ordering.
      This improved solving speed by over 2 orders of magnitude.  Added
      stepcommand, bestfitcommand, and related attributes.
    * all cipher types:  Moved stepcommand, bestfitcommand, and related
      attributes to the cipher header struct.  Cleaned up delete procedures

      keys and twosquare keys.
    * progs/hillclimb:  Minor variable name change.  If a partial key is
      entered, assume that it represents the fixed portion of a partially

      sense.  VigenereUndo was also fixed so that it properly cleared
      the first column.
    * Added "best tip location" method for vigenere types.  Tip is dragged
      along the cipher until the best set of digrams is produced.

Thu Sep 17 12:18:49 PDT 1998 wart@kobold.org
    * Finished writing and testing route.c.

      a trisquare tip based on the number of naturals in each possible tip
      location.
    * library/hillclimb.tcl:  Added new routine for performing a hillclimb
      on every possible pat tip location.  This turns out to be very useful

      hillclimbing a pat cipher where the tip location is not known.
    * progs/pathilltipsearch:
    * progs/cmbifidsolve:  Use the new library routine for performing a
      hillclimb on every possible pat tip location.

      long.

Thu Aug  7 12:33:45 CEST 2003 wart@kobold.org

      two orders of magnitude.  It's now possible to go through all 2^26
      possible baconian keys and filter out the invalid bacon text (anything
      that causes a group to start with 2 b's) in under 10 seconds on a 2.4GHz
      computer.
    * route.c:  Fixed bug in route autosolver that was causing it not to
      restore the cipher to the best known route when finished.

      precedence.
    * configure.in:
    * configure:
    * cipher.spec:  Bumped version to 1.5.6

Tue Aug  5 14:47:58 CEST 2003 wart@kobold.org

    * cipherInit.c:  Removed false comment.
    * cipherUtil.c:  Removed some unnecessary debugging lines.
    * aristocrat.c:  Removed a small memory leak in the tip location

    * phillips.c:  Attempts to make more small optimizations.  Looks like
      they had very little effect.
    * all cipher types:  Made decipher procedure semantics identical across
      all ciphers.  Get* procs do not set interpreter result, that is the
      prerogative of the caller.   Use more efficient method when freeing
      the memory for the deciphered plaintext; instead of creating a duplicate,
      just pass control of the memory to the Tcl interpreter.
    * All C files:  Added debug header file that gets used only if dmalloc
      support is turned on.
    * cipher.c:  Don't double-delete the cipher object if there was an
      error creating the cipher object command.

    * vigTypes.c:  Removed expensive pt/ct/key conversion routines for
      vigenere types as they have been replaced with lightweight macros.
    * vvb.c:  Use the new macros to simplify the code.  It's much more
      readable now.
    * nicodemus.c:  Use a (semi)static buffer for storing the nicodemus
      plaintext so that we don't have to reallocate memory for every call
      to GetNicodemus().  Removed some unused code.  Added a faster
      solving routine that fits the alphabet before permuting the ordering.
      This improved solving speed by over 2 orders of magnitude.  Added
      stepcommand, bestfitcommand, and related attributes.

      is specified.
    * progs/histogram:  Remove spaces from the ciphertext before periodizing
      the ciphertext.
    * progs/ioc:  Added "-type" argument for performing ioc calculations on
      non-simple periodic ciphers.  Currenly only phillips is supported.
    * progs/nicsolve:  Use built-in nicodemus solve method for solving.
    * progs/csolve:  Use a more realistic step interval for showing the
      progress of a columnar solve session.
    * progs/genboard:  Print out the phillips board in groups of 8 per row
      so that all blocks for the same row line up vertically.

      split the pt up into real words.
    * tests/nicodemus.test:  Added tests for step/best fit commands.

      fit commands.  Added step/best fit command and related attributes to
      cipher header struct.
    * cipher.c:  Added utility methods for setting the step/best fit commands.
      Added a delete procedure that must be called by all cipher types when
      deleting the cipher command.  This delete procedure can be used in lieu
      of defining a cipher-specific delete procedure if the cipher has no
      cipher-specific cleanup to perform.
    * digram.c:  Optimized the digram value routines.  Sped up autosolving of
      columnar ciphers by an order of magnitude.
    * solvemysz.c:  Optimized by replacing expensive digram calculation
      with trivial table lookup.  Reduced completion times by almost an
      order of magnitude.

    * Massive nicodemus improvements.
    * nicodemus.c:  Removed restriction on nicodemus period that was
      preventing the use of a period > 9.  Letters are now used to

      for nicodemus column orders.
    * progs/nicsolve:

      read the cipher from stdin instead of a file named '-'.
    * library/dictionary.tcl:  Fixed bug that was causing the dictionary
      cache to become corrupted when adding new words.
    * tests/dictionary.test:  Make two passes through testsuite, once with

      sense.  VigenereUndo was also fixed so that it properly cleared
      the first column.
    * Added "best tip location" method for vigenere types.  Tip is dragged
      along the cipher until the best set of digrams is produced.

Thu Sep 17 12:18:49 PDT 1998 wart@kobold.org
    * Finished writing and testing route.c.

    * Added bestfitcommand et al. options to pollux, morbit, and columnar
      ciphers.
    * MyszcowskiRestoreOrder() was complaining about invalid characters.
      It wasn't converting from key -> keyval before checking.
      (key - 'a' = keyval)

      were found in the ciphertext.
    * Added nihilist transposition type "nitrans" to tcipher

Fri Nov 13 15:58:32 PST 1998 wart@kobold.org
