<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<DL>


    <P>
    <DT><A NAME="patsearch"><B><CODE>patsearch -file filename -type k1|k2|k3 ?-scoretype type? ?-language language? ?-keyword word? ?-addspace?</CODE></B></A></DT>
        <DD><B>patsearch</B> is an autosolver for patristocrat (and aristocrat)
ciphers.
<P>
<B>filename</B> is the name of the file that contains the ciphertext.
<BR>
<B>keytype</B> is one of <B>k1</B>, <B>k2</B>, or <B>k3</B>.
<P>
This program loads keywords from an external dictionary.
The dictionary must be laid out as a set
of files, with each file containing a list of words (in
any order) all of the same length, one word per line.
The filenames must start with the string <B>len</B> and
end with a 2 digit number describing the length of the
words inside the file.  For example, the file
<B>len04</B> could contain:
<P>
<CODE>
very<BR>
that<BR>
lean<BR>
keys<BR>
used<BR>
type<BR>
foot<BR>
mine<BR>
eery<BR>
flee<BR>
</CODE>

<P>
The <b>patsearch</b> program looks for every dictionary file and attempts to
use each word found as the keyword.  If you are using a very large dictionary
this could take quite a long time.  Use the <B>-keyword</B> option to limit the search to a single known keyword.  This can be useful if you have determined the key from some other method and just want to decipher the ciphertext using the keyword.
<P>
Currently the location of the dictionary is hardcoded to the directory
<CODE>$HOME/share/dict</CODE>.  You can change this by editting the
<B>patsearch</B> program and modifying the line where <CODE>Dictionary::directory</CODE>
is set.
<P>
The default scoring method is to use a sum-of-logs-of-digram-frequencies table.  This can be changed to any scoring method supported by the <A HREF="cipher/score.html">score</A> command.  The <b>-language</b> option is used to load
a scoring table for the specified language, if such a scoring table exists.
<P>The <b>-addspace</b> option will attempt to locate word boundaries after the final solution has been found.  This can be a time and memory intensive process on older computers so it is turned off by default.
