        <DD><B>keysquaresearch</B> is an autosolver for cipher types that use a single
keysquare.  These include

<P>
This program loads keywords from an external dictionary.
The dictionary must be laid out as a set
of files, with each file containing a list of words (in
any order) all of the same length, one word per line.
The filenames must start with the string <B>len</B> and
end with a 2 digit number describing the length of the
words inside the file.  For example, the file
<B>len04</B> could contain:
<P>
<CODE>
very<BR>
that<BR>
lean<BR>
keys<BR>
used<BR>
type<BR>
foot<BR>
mine<BR>
eery<BR>
flee<BR>
</CODE>

<P>
The <B>keysquaresearch</B> program looks through every dictionary file and
attempts to use each word found as the keyword.  The keywords are used to
generate keysquares by writing in the keyed alphabet in
48 different routes.  Each resulting
keysquare is then applied to the cipher and the keysquare with the best
digram/trigram frequency count is displayed.  If the keyword is already known
then the <b>-keyword</b> option can be used to decrypt the cipher quickly.
<P>
The default scoring method is to use a sum-of-logs-of-digram-frequencies table.  This can be changed to any scoring method supported by the <A HREF="cipher/score.html">score</A> command.  The <b>-language</b> option is used to load
a scoring table for the specified language, if such a scoring table exists.
<P>The <b>-addspace</b> option will attempt to locate word boundaries after the final solution has been found.  This can be a time and memory intensive process on older computers so it is turned off by default.
