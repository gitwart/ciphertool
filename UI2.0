*No Solve Functionality*

Pluggable UI for manipulating ciphers
    provide a workarea for performing manipulations
    provide a frame for typing in commands/inputs
    provide a display for showing the key
    provide a buttonbar for common commands
    modify the ciphertext for an existing cipher (fix typos)
Allow multiple ciphers to be open for manipulating


File -> New
    Opens a new cipher in a new tab
File -> Open
    Loads a saved cipher in a new tab and sets the name of the current
    savefile
File -> Save
    Saves the current cipher to the current savefile
File -> Save As
    Saves the current cipher to a file specified by the user and sets
    the name of the current savefile.
File -> Close
    Closes the current tab.
File -> Exit
    Exits the application

Commands -> (cipher specific)
    Locate Tip
    Set Period
    Clear
